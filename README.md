# to do
- Tests  - 
- Deployment  - docker etc.
- Visualization - based on the backend statistics, display the results of the text entered.  A basic html page is fine or, if you want to get fancy (and you have experience), you could create some visualization (e.g., radar graph).
- Embellishments:  Documentation website, auto format, heroku, code style, commit msg checker
- Show errors 
- - Validation - If you have experience with web development then write some basic JavaScript to check the validity of the input (e.g., that there's something there, that it has at least one sentence, etc.).
